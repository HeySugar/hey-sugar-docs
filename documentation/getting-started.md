HeySugar is a self hosted website. Think of it like a self hosted instance of WordPress...but with no servers (Jamstack). You don't need to be totally familiar with React, Gatsby or Sanity to get started with HeySugar. But being comfortable with installing NPM packages will be beneficial.

To make things easier, we have also put together some videos that you can follow when setting up the system. Please be aware that HeySugar is in it's very early stages and there **may be bugs along the way**. If you do find a bug then please [raise an issue on our Github](https://github.com/HeySugar/hey-sugar-app).

## Pre Requisites

Before getting started, please make sure you have the following.

- A [Netlify Account](https://netlify.com)
- A [Sanity Account](https://sanity/io)

### Getting Started with Sanity

Sanity is a system designed for creating and managing structured content. We will be using Sanity to store your blood sugar test results. You will also use Sanity to create, modify and delete results.
